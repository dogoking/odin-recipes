    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups of Eru/Ukazi</li>
            <li>3 bags/bundles of spinach/waterleaf</li>
            <li>2-3 pounds of meat/fish of choice(beef skin/canda, beef stripes, beef, goat meat, dried/smoked fish, stocked fish, snails, and/or others)</li>
            <li>2 cups of crayfish</li>
            <li>3 cups of palm oil plus half cup of canola (or groundnut) oil</li>
            <li>1 crayfish seasoning cube (Maggi Crevette)</li>
            <li>1 Habanero pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are using dried Eru, start by soaking it in water.</li>
            <li>Wash your meat and put in the pot to boil. I used beef skin and beef stripes AKA canda and towel.</li>
            <li>While the meat boils, chop your spinach or waterleaf and set aside.</li>
            <li>When your meat is half-boiled, season with salt. When it is cooked, add in spinach and start stirring. Spinach is quite soft and will shrink fast as seen below.</li>
            <li>Then you drain Eru and add to pot. The small liquid from the Spinach will make the Eru soft.</li>
            <li>Add in your fish and mix. I had some already boiled stock fish so I threw it in.</li>
            <li>Then add the oil, seasoning cube and lastly crayfish. Tip : Mixing palm oil and canola/vegetable oil keeps the oil from becoming hard when the Eru is cold.</li>
            <li>Stir well and voila, Eru is ready. Serve with Water Fufu (Akpu), Garri or even Pounded Yam.</li>
